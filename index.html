			<h1>Since I don't like other people's code …</h1>
			
			<p>
				Please misunderstand the heading. Other people's code is great, but I prefer to assemble my own HTML and CSS boilerplate. There are great projects out there, like the HTML5 Boilerplate, Skeleton, and LESS Framework; but I really can't just drop in their markup and CSS into my projects without a thorough investigation and reverse-engineering session first. Therefore I've created this personal toolbox of mine, which I always use when I start off a new project.
			</p>
			
			<h2>What is this?</h2>
			<p>
				This 'Compass Kit' of mine is a <strong>fluid, responsive, boilerplate in HTML and CSS, built with Compass and Sass</strong>. It evolved from my personal work and laziness – who has time to completely rebuild the boilerplate HTML and CSS for every project? Summary: this is my personal toolbox, and the code may change due to my mood, industry advice, and by plain obsessive compulsive refactoring. I usually drop this package into newly created projects, adjust and set some site specific variables, perhaps remove stuff I don't need, and start building.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Thanks to my obsessive eagerness to collect all the web development world's best practices, this kit includes up-to-date cutting edge stuff, as well as responsible fallbacks for older browsers. Progressive enhancements – oh yeah.
				
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This kit includes <strong>as few CSS classes and static values as possible</strong>. It's not up to me to decide how you organize your CSS. I personally hate it when a CSS framework dictates everything, and I end up deleting tens of lines of code just because I don't need it. This kit <strong>doesn't get in your way</strong>, and even includes a customized version of <a href="http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a> CSS reset instead of a regular shotgun reset. Thanks to Normalize.css, we get a nice cross-browser and consistent markup environment instead of hard reseting all elements.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Compass &amp; Sass</h2>
			<p>
				There's one thing different with this package though: it's built with <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a>. You should start use those technologies right now. It's like CSS4, but available for us to use today. Please study the Compass reference for tons of ways to use the tool. I'm sure you'll find a couple of nifty solution in this package's code. For a quick walkthrough, check out the <a href="https://github.com/johanbrook/Johan-Compass-Kit">readme on GitHub</a>.
			</p>
			
			<h3>What's in the box?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Great typography setup based on a modular, golden, scale (<a href="http://modularscale.com/scale/?px1=14&px2=308&ra1=1.618&ra2=0">reference table</a>)</li>
				
				<li>Handy Sass mixins</li>
				<li>Organized file structure (see below)</li>
				<li>Helper classes, and more.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Modularity</h3>
			<p>
				I hate messy CSS files. However, Sass provides the <code>@import</code> construct, where we can import a CSS or Sass file into another Sass file, without using more HTTP requests. It's great. Take a look at the directory structure in the GitHub repo: it really is a "each file in its own place" philosophy:
				
			</p>
			
			<div class="group">
				
			<figure class="column third">
				<pre>
/sass
	master
	- library/normalize
	- compass/css3

	- base
		- library/variables
		- library/mixins
		- library/helpers
	
		- common
			- common/fonts

/stylesheets
	ie.css
	master.css
			</pre>
			<figcaption>The file structure of my Compass Kit</figcaption>
			
			</figure>
			
			<p>
				See what's going on to the left? If you do, I know I've done this right. Each file in its own place. Feel free to come up with your own organization. I've found this structure quite neat – separating the CSS code into modules is sooo good. All of the files in the <code>sass</code> folder compiles into a single <code>master.css</code> file. Awesome. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The goal of a file strucure like this is when you're looking for a specific selector, you should just <em>know</em> where that is located. It <em>shouldn't</em> have to take you more than a couple of seconds to look that up.
			</p>
			
			
			<h2>Quick &amp; Dirty</h2>
			<p>
				What follows is all commonly used HTML elements (including the ones in defined in HTML5) listed, for rapid testing and experimenting. I've included the Javascript tool <a href="http://hashgrid.com">Hashgrid</a> which lets you define grid overlays to make sure everything line up. Try it out by pressing and holding '<kbd>G</kbd>' on your keyboard. This <strong>12</strong> column grid has a <strong>24 px baseline</strong> and is <strong>992px</strong> wide. This makes every column <strong>68px wide</strong> and the gutters <strong>16px</strong> Measurements may be adjusted in the files <code>_base.scss</code> and <code>library/_hashgrid.scss</code> – it's completely up to you. Thanks to the variables in Sass, there are no hardcoded widths in my boilerplate. 
			
			</p>
			

			<h2>Outro</h2>
			
			<p>
				I really don't have the time to build one of these fancy promo sites for this boilerplate package. As I mentioned: this is primarly for myself. If you want it, it's in a <a href="https://github.com/johanbrook/Johan-Compass-Kit">GitHub repo</a> (you can clone or download over there). The included <a href="https://github.com/johanbrook/Johan-Compass-Kit/blob/master/README.md">Readme</a> should provide enough intel to get you off the ground. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are no crazy CSS class names to keep in mind, just a couple of helper classes. The best way to learn is actually to study the code – not reading some abstract readme – so dive in! Study the import scheme, the variables, the custom mixins. You'll like it.
			</p>
